# Dynamic Arrays
Both C and C++ has a weird quirks compared to other langauges: pointers. Pointers are notorously
hard to understand for new programmers, and many languages arose due to the fact that complexity
of maintaining them throughout the program. This may be so, but on a small programs, these are not 
much of difficulties. The dynamic arrays for C and C++ are created in runtime to demonstrate 
how it can be implemented using memory allocation.

On C++, the dynamic array also includes smart pointer implementation as a reference.
