# Data Structures and Algorithms
Here are some of Data Structures and Algorithms implementation in various programming languages. They're not perfect, but merely on here for self-note.
By no means this should be used as learning tools, but as a reference. 

### Why this repo
You should, as much as possible, find a general book on Data Structures and Algorithms and implement it then. Having said that, some of the books are
somewhat difficult to implement across the langauges. I've done as much as I can to have the codes somewhat parallel to each other, but 
there may be some that are not exactly the same. Those will be referenced on the markdown files. 

As it currently stands, the repo should have the following languages:
- C
- C++
- Java
- JavaScript

The goal is to add the following languages:
- Python
- C#
- Kotlin
- Swift
